## Thoughts for him
I didn't really read any book yet from [[Niklas Luhamann]] I knew him in how to take smart notes But thinking forward to see his creating.
- One negative thought for him:
	-	The poineer [Conrad Gessner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_Gessner) didn't have the hype in the book. He got the hype cuz he did something create with the method
	-	About the poineer nobody known's about him except the wikipedia page.
