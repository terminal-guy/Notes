## My worst Nightmare and worstcase Scenario
My worst nightmare is that I being like my father for rest of life. cuz He is slave and he don't have the money or time or anything in his life to be shown as sucessful. He lived his like a slave and as a employee and he points out his past and repeats them and not looking in into the future vision. He is almost dead in his dream cuz he is going to retire in like 25 days. [[Retirement Is Worst-Case Scenario Insurance]]
