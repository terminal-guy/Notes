- Go to a stranger and borrow $100
	- He got into first challenge. He got down to the office and a big guy near the desk. **Can I borrow $100 from you** And the guy said No,**Why** and [[Jia Jang]] ran from there. As he was shooting the challenge video. He gone to home and like the guy who could see the dead man with the sixth sense. while he was watching the video he was a big guy he was just a little chubby and he didn't hurt him he just asked **Why** Infact, he invited me to explain why you want 100 bucks. Everytime he felt the slightest rejection he would run 
- Request a burger refill 
- Ask for a olympic doughnuts 
- Ask to the starbucks greeter
	- He asked the person that I can be a starbuck greeter. And the guy told 'Not Sure' and he mentioned **Is that weird?** that means he wasn't weird.
That's means he was like thinking like the guy in starbucks seeing this as a weird thing. again and again if I learned that If I mention some doubt that people before I ask the question people are gaining their trust. People more likely to say yes to him.

> Then he learned that he could fullfill my dream by asking.
