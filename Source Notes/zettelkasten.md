## How He got this idea

Professor [[Niklas Luhamann]] Used this method using index of flash cards. But the book suggests that the technology has developed Everyone using evernote and some kind of note taking software That can be used as a alternative for index cards and putting them into the boxes.

Professor [[Niklas Luhamann]] will come from home after his 9to5 and doing his research & note taking stuff that all researcher's do he was using book margins to take notes like everyone.
But He found this method ineffcient and takes a lot of time to find for specific note for s specific topic.

So he came up with A new method for taking notes that is called the [[zettelkasten]] method.

## How did he intergrate this zettelkasten method.
He uses index cards to take notes like using the front page for taking literature notes and back side of card for taking brief notes and he puts that in the specific topic into a reference(source) box and Once he gather's up all the information he makes a new note or idea note. He calls that idea or note permanent(evergreen) notes he puts that note into a permanent box and he uses to put tags/reference words on cards to easily find the note he was looking for. ^6f4720

## How it serves him
He is not like everyone of use. Like you have a idea for a week and forget about this like forever. He has is permanent idea/note in one box. So that it can serve in better
