# What is bootstrap #blog-development 

Bootstrap is a css framework to build mobile application in way of not caring much too in the frontend We can build a pretty beautiful UI with bootstrap but we can use other frameworks tailwindcss and bulma but boostrap is very easy to use with django and It's has CDN support that can be used with plain html file.

## Downside for using CDN for bootstrap
You can't customize bootstrap css if you wont able to do that You want to use source files.
