# Futures vs Async Code
-   Async code is code that runs and it might take bit longer and that shouldn't stop other code from continuing. And it will be available in the future.
-   Every programming languages have their way of doing things asynchronously but dart have it own class future.
-   In any future we can check if the future is done with using .then
-   You can call another then block in the then block returns a new future.
-   You can also get error you can catch error using catcherror().
