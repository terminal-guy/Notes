### The Headmaster
Did got to headmaster for getting his sign for group. 
**He Asked why are you taking commerce with computers application** 
	I said that I am good with computers he asked what are good at. I said do you remember me I came for not attending online classes for 2 weeks. I told i was good at programming and making apps.
	He said that why are you 4th group if you were good with computers. I said I can get more time if i am taking 1st group i will not have time to do my work. I refered tim ferris and more So i can convince him to give me 4th group **I really think he really cares for everyone to get in high position**.
	I also said i will have a startup but I don't have anyidea of startup idea. 
	I do startup or something likes startup like business but I really think there must be be do like that in future like solving a problem.
	He said I don't compel you to take 1st group it's you decision. You can go down and discuess about the changing group.
	That what the worst cuz My father did really dig into my head select 1st group and made me really confused. My father he doesn't know shit what the hell happening in the world and he acts as he knowns everything. 
	I made a clever decision that I want 4th group and climb through the mountain of stairs of school steps and standing in line and my father starring with his face and with the anger and said **Take 1st group and go for enginnering** 
	I got really frustated and climb down the stairs like a angry men with a uncontrollable amount of anger.  
	And I got calm down a little bit and Said that **I would push you off the building if you talk another word.**
	And got to headmaster room and he asked which group i said 4th group and the conversation was over.
