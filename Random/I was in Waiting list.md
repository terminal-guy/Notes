### I was in Waiting list

I thought my name can missed while taking the selected list cuz I changed group from 1st group to 4th group before 4 days of headmaster sending message like you will have test for your 11th group selection but I they didn't have test they had interview with the headmaster.

I came to food arena in the school they didn't allow us to speak to headmaster cuz they lied to use that headmaster is in meeting like as usual. I gave my name to franklin sir they said i was in waiting list I was literally shocked cuz I have great scores on 10th revison test but they told that they will select from the 9th standart marks I got literally busted by it cuz I got failed in maths but I had the scored 49/50 in the next maths text. 
 
They called me as the third person but i gave the name as the 27th one but got at the number of 3 cuz I they classified using my marks. My marks was pretty good on other subjects.
