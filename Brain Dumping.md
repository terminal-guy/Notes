### The Basic Dump
It involves removing the “over thinking” thoughts from your mind and placing them somewhere else. This can help you live more freely throughout each day as the things that are troubling you are being resolved.
This is helping your brain relax because it no longer has to remind you to focus on the issue because you have recognized it.

this process would be to take the brain dump list you wrote on the end of the week, say, Friday, and then on Monday take one item off your list and begin to tackle it. And then on Tuesday, take another item off your list and tackle it, and so forth. Or, you can just pick one other day of the week to “attack” your To Do list portion of your brain dump.
